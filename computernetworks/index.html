	 			<p>When two or more computers are connected together with the ability to communicate with one another, they create what’s known as a “computer network”. They allow us to share information, share hardware, communicate, perform simple tasks such as printing, or perform complex tasks such as video conferencing. Without computer networks, computers would simply be pieces of hardware that can perform complex functions, but not be able to directly send nor receive information.</p>

	 					<h3>Local Area Network (LAN)</h3><p>A computer network, first utilized in the 1970s, connected in a close geographical range, such as a group of buildings, computer lab or home. These computers can communicate to each other directly in most setups, and make for quick, convenient, and private access for applications and services on the connected computers to interact.</br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">Read more about LANs</a>.</p>
	 				</div>	
		 		
			 		<div>
			 			<h3>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h3><p>A computer network connected in a further geographical range (relative to a LAN), such as an entire city or country. Connecting each computer in the network (referred to as &ldquo;nodes&rdquo;) can be a variety of media types such as telephone lines, radio waves, or cables. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network">Read more about WANs</a>.</p>
			 		</div>		 		
			 	
			 		<div>
			 			<h3>Backbone Network</h3><p>A backbone network provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone network has the capability to connect networks in the same building, different neighboring buildings, or over wider areas. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network">Read more about backbone networks</a>.</p>

			 			<h3>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h3><p>A VPN creates private links across public networks (i.e. the Internet). In essence, it creates a private link on a shared network using encryption and tunneling techniques to provide for greater security from public access.</br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn">Read more about VPNs</a>.</p>
			 		</div>		 		
			 
			 		<div>
			 			<h3>Intranet</h3><p>An intranet is an internal network that implements web technologies (like browsers, servers, etc.) and is under the control of a single administrative account. Intranets run the <a href="http://www.linktionary.com/t/tcp.html">TCP</a>/<a href="http://www.linktionary.com/i/ip.html">IP</a> protocol and other internet-related protocols that are essentially the network&rsquo;s language used to relay information. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">Read more about intranets</a>.</p>

			 			<h3>Domain Name</h3>
			 			<p>A domain name serves two primary purposes:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Provides unique identification for a given realm in the Internet, such as a server hosting a website, a personal computer, or a website itself.</li>
							<li>Keeps IP addresses invisible for most users, which are technical and not of much use to the everyday Internet user. Domain names are much easier to read and understand.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the fundamental system for assigning named addresses to Internet sites and any other resource connected to the Internet or private network.  DNS is responsible for the IP address translation discussed above. The DNS is also responsible for mapping these IP addresses to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritative_name_server#Authoritative_name_server">authoritative name servers</a> which have the ability to assign additional sub-domains for the domain. Sub-domains are domains which could be considered the children of a larger domain structure. The only domain that is not a sub-domain is the primary, root domain.</p>

						<p>Regarding why domain names need to be purchased, the purchase of a domain name is actually not the purchase of the name itself. It’s a rental from a domain name registrar. What users actually pay for is the service of routing the IP address and domain name to a DNS server, allowing the domain name to be hosted somewhere (otherwise it would lead to nowhere). Users also pay for the management and support of these servers.</p>
						
						<p>A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the primary methods used to provide structure to the Internet. It is the domain name suffix and is at the highest level of the Internet’s domain name system. Some examples of TLDs are .com, .net, .org and .edu. These are known as generic TLDs. country code TLDs also exist, such as .uk (United Kingdom), .cz (Czech Republic), .it (Italy), and .id (Indonesia). For a full list of TLDs, go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">here</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">Read more about domains</a>.</p>

			 			<h3>Firewall</h3><p>A firewall is an important security element that serves as a gateway controlling the flow of data being transferred between networks. Firewalls can be applied at many different points such as between internal networks and the public Internet or between internal networks. The safest firewalls restrict all traffic except for the rules set by the network administrator that specify exactly what is allowed in and out. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">Read more about firewalls</a>.</p>

			 			<h3>Internet Protocol (IP) Address</h3><p>An IP address is a number given to each computer communicating in a computer network. Its two primary purposes are to identify the machine itself and to identify the location of the machine. Without an IP address, computers in a network would not be able to exchange information. There are two types of IP addresses, private and public, the primary difference being that private IP addresses are utilized on private networks and public IP addresses on the Internet.</p><p>The user’s Internet service provider (ISP) assigns public IP address to allow computers to connect to the Internet, with the network router acting as the throughway between the private network and the public network (the Internet). This public IP address might change every time the user connects if they are setup to use what’s called a dynamic IP address. Otherwise, their IP address is static. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address">Read more about IP addresses.</a></p>

	 					<h3>Router</h3><p>A router is an internetworking device that connects segments of a network and forwards data packets to specified parts of the network according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing tables</a>. Routers can be relatively inexpensive home/office components that connect to and manage small networks of computers, but are also the hardware that play a significant role in connecting the Internet. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">Read more about routers</a>.</p>
