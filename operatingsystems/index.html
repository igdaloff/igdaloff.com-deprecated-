	 			<p>An operating system is the underlying infrastructure, in the form of installed software, that supports a computer’s basic functions. These functions include opening and running applications and scheduling tasks. Prior to the proliferation of operating systems, computers were primarily built to run series of individual functions.  Operating systems allow the computer to run many functions simultaneously in addition to (more recently) providing a graphical user interface for the user to interact with the computer directly. (Note that not all operating systems consider the user interface, if there is one at all, to be part of the operating system).</p>
	 			 
	 			<p>Another prominent feature of operating systems is their ability to adjust over time. Meaning, the user can manipulate the way the machine’s hardware and software works via the operating system.</p>
				 
				<p>Simply put, an operating system manages the hardware and software resources on a computer, controlling everything from drivers and CPU management to applications and memory. It provides a simplified and consistent way for software to communicate with the hardware.

			<p>The Unix operating system lies at the foundation of many of the advanced technologies that we use today: computer aided design, digital simulations and even the Internet. &ldquo;Today, without Unix systems, the Internet would come to a screeching halt. Most telephone calls could not be made, electronic commerce would grind to a halt and there would have never been &lsquo;Jurassic Park&rsquo;!&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.Unix.org/what_is_Unix/history_timeline.html">Source</a>)</p>
			 
			<p>In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and a handful of other AT&T programmers at Bell Labs began working on an operating system that would soon become Unix. Its initial use was word processing for patent documents. It wasn’t until the sixth edition (1975) that Unix left Bell Labs and became a widely available operating system. By this time it was written in C. AT&T released the first supported version, Unix System V, in 1983.  In 1984, with the debates of Unix’s strengths and weaknesses raging, a significant concept was developed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(computing)">open systems</a>. Open systems would meet agreed upon standards and specifications, but would give individuals unrestricted access to the configuration of the operating system.</p>
			 
			<p>By this time, over 100,000 Unix installations can be found across the globe. This number would soon grow to 750,000 as Unix System V Release 3 comes into being (1987), and then to 1.2 million with Release 4 (1989). In 1995, the Unix 95 was introduced for computer systems and met the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Unix_Specification">Single Unix Specification</a>, which had reached a critical mass &ldquo;where vendors whose products have met the demanding criteria now account for the majority of Unix systems by value.&rdquo; In 2007, Apple’s Mac OS X operating system was certified to Unix.</p>
			 
			<p>Many hands have touched the Unix operating system throughout its development. In addition to AT&T and the Unix System Group, these include Novell (who bought the Unix System Laboratory in 1991), X/Open, and The Open Group (formed when X/Open merged with Open Software Foundation in 1996).</p>
			 
			<p>The Unix operating system is primarily used in servers, desktops and mobile devices. The ubiquity of Unix can be attributed to the following features: the use of plain text for storing data, its hierarchal file structure, and the use of a variety of software tools which can be connected via a command line interpreter. Some varieties of the Unix operating system include: Solaris, AIX, BSD/OS, IRIX, MAC OS, and Linux.</p>
			 
			<p>Looking forward, Unix plans to release features to improve the operating systems’ robustness, better handle the globalization of computing, and create higher quality API sets.</p>

			<p>Mac OS X, released by Apple Inc. in 1999, was built from the original Mac OS and Rhapsody, the NeXT-based operating system (previously OPENSTEP and NeXTSTEP). Mac OS X beta didn’t materialize until 2000. The operating system is a Unix-based graphical system based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_kernel">Mach kernel</a>.</p> 
			 
			<p>Since its first public release in 2001, the versions of Mac OS X have been named after big felines. Examples include Cheetah, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Snow Leopard, and, most recently, Lion (2011).</p>
			 
			<p>The major characteristics of Mac OS X include:</p>
			 
				<ul>
					<li>The appealing and user-friendly graphical interface</li>
					<li>Its breadth of features, such as the Finder (for file browsing), Time Machine (for backing up files), and Expose (for easing the transition between desktop and windows)</li>
					<li>Its layered framework, which allows for rapid development of applications by providing existing code for similar tasks</li>

			<p>Code-named &ldquo;Interface Manager&rdquo;, Bill Gates and Microsoft launched Windows in 1983 as a graphical user interface (GUI) development of its current operating system MS-DOS. Previously, users were required to type MS-DOS commands, whereas Windows allows users to point and click with the use of a mouse.</p>
			 
			<p>There have been many flavors and versions of Windows, including OS/2, Windows 95, NT, XP, and most recently, Windows 7. Soon to follow Windows 7 is Windows 8, which will add support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM microprocessors</a> and a new interface that was built for touchscreen usage in addition to keyboard and mouse.</p>
			 
			<p>Windows is popular due to its simple user interface, low cost, array of desktop applications, and the fact that it comes standard on PCs.</p>

			<p>Finnish student Linus Torvalds began working on a new operating system kernel in 1991 that would eventually become Linux. Previously, Richard Stallman and Andrew Tanenbaum released the GNU Project and MINIX, respectively. However, these projects were either not open for modification and redistribution, or were not well suited for the new 32-bit features of the new Intel computers becoming popular at the time. Because of this, Torvald was determined to write his own operating system (although Linux was developed using features of both GNU and MINIX).</p>
			 
			<p>Linux has a wide variety of uses, though it is primarily utilized for:</p>
			 
				<ul>
					<li>web serving (often paired with the popular Apache)</li>
					<li>networking (Linux is based on Unix, which is used heavily to run the Internet)</li>
					<li>databases (good for storing information due to its stability)</li>
					<li>desktops and home computing (because of its stability and flexibility)</li>
				</ul>
			 
			<p>(<a href="http://www.lugod.org/presentations/ca4h/used_for.html">Source</a>)</p>
			 
			<p>British computer programmer Alan Cox, who has been associated with Linux since its inception, maintained version 2.2 of the operating system through 2003. Marcello Tosatti, a Brazilian developer, maintained version 2.4 of the Linux kernel through 2006. Andrew Morton, an Australian software engineer, currently manages the 2.6 kernel, which was released in late 2003.</p>
			 
			<p>In addition to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base">Linux Standard Base</a>, there are many varieties of the Linux kernel, including: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSUSE.</p> 
			 
			<p>The future of Linux lies in mobile platforms (Android, primarily, experts predict), global compatibility and availability in developing countries. Linux Version 3.0 was released in July 2011 and the next version is expected to appear in 2012. (<a href="http://www.ghabuntu.com/2011/04/5-reasons-why-linux-is-future-of.html">Source</a>)</p>

			<p>Oracle Corporation’s Solaris is a Unix-based operating system initially released in 1992. Sun Microsystems developed and owned the operating system (which replaced their SunOS in 1993) until 2010 when Oracle purchased Sun.</p>
			 
			<p>Solaris was proprietary software until 2005 when Sun Microsystems opened up its codebase and founded the OpenSolaris open source project. The operating system is particularly known for its speed, scalability, reliability, and security, and is especially practical for enterprise applications and cloud computing.</p>
			 
			<p>In November 2011, Oracle released Solaris 11, enhancing its network and server virtualization, software packaging, storage, security and hardware support.</p>
			 
			<p>Oracle also owns a less-popular operating system called Oracle Linux that is based off Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It is a free operating system with 8,000 subscribed customers.</p>
