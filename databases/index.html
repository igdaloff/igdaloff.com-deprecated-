	 			<p>Databases provide the capability of storing and retrieving information for computer applications. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Relational databases</a> use tables (composed of columns and rows) to store this information. This type of database makes it easier for users to search, organize and establish comparisons among a variety of data points.</p>
	 			 
	 			<p>Relational databases are typically composed of anywhere from 10 to over 1,000 tables, each being connected to another in a logical manner. For example, one table might have two columns, City ID # and City Name. Another might have Participant Name and City ID #. The programmer, using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql">structured query language</a> (SQL), would create a relationship between the two City ID # fields in order to eliminate redundancy and create an efficient set of tables.</p>
				 
				<p>Designed by Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce in 1974, SQL is the standard language for database interoperability and management. The language is based on relational algebra and calculus. Generally speaking, it has the ability to perform the following functions: data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control.</p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysql">MySQL</a> is the world&rsquo;s most popular relational database management system (RDBMS). Michael Widenius led the development of the system until its release in May of 1995. Prior to its purchase by the Oracle Corporation, MySQL was owned by the Swedish company MySQL AB.</p>
			 
			<p>This RDBMS has many strengths, including its ease of use and reliability. It is currently the database of choice for the current generation of applications which are commonly built on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python). Due to the fact that MySQL is open source, and can therefore utilize other open source applications and code, it is utilized on many popular websites today, such as Google, Flickr and YouTube. On its own, however, MySQL has an inferior security relative to competitors. Also, MySQL only supports the SQL database language, and therefore is less flexible in this way.</p>
			 
			<p>MySQL is open source and Oracle intends to keep it that way in the future in order to promote its ubiquity. Primarily they provide support services and product enhancements. Some of these future product enhancements include improved monitoring and backup services.</p>

			<p>Larry Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates developed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle Database software</a> in 1977 while working in their consultancy Software Development Laboratories (SDL). The software is an object-relational database management system and is now produced and supported by Oracle Corporation.</p> 
			 
			<p>Oracle Database is highly backwards compatible, meaning many of its previous versions and their features are still supported. The system also offers a powerful combination of advanced technology and comprehensive, business applications, making it an ideal DBMS option for banks and large corporations. As a result, Oracle Database is generally more expensive (also, not open source) and more complicated to setup/administer than its competitors.</p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">Microsoft SQL Server</a> is a relational database management system developed and maintained by Microsoft Corporation. The base Microsoft SQL Server code was purchased from Sybase SQL Server in the mid 1980s and was Microsoft&rsquo;s entry into the DBMS market.</p>
			 
			<p>Microsoft SQL Server is great for scalability. This means that the system works well for small businesses and can continue to function as necessary through large growth. Another advantage of Microsoft SQL Server is the use of stored procedures. Stored procedures are lines of code that are called by the application and allow for quicker response times.</p>
			 
			<p>There are also some disadvantages to Microsoft SQL Server, including the fact that the software is not open source. Also, small businesses and home users may find it too expensive and advanced for their use, not to mention the higher price. In addition, to use the software, programmers are required to learn a different language and setup for the Microsoft SQL Server environment.</p>
